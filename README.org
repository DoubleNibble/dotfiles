The 'replicable' heart of my computer(s)

* Obtaining

To get my *dotfiles* (which I don't know why you would), run the below commands 
at `~`:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/myTerminal/dotfiles.git
git fetch --all
rm .bash*
git checkout master
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Contents

** Setup

*dotfiles* contains software setup for multiple operating platforms and starts
if it finds a compatible one.

To start setup, run the following command in a terminal running bash:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
. .setup/start
#+END_EXAMPLE

On start, [[https://github/myTerminal/twiner][twiner]] is fetched as a
dependency which provides most of the underlying features.

If you're running a shell different than bash, run something like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
bash .setup/start
#+END_EXAMPLE

The setup scripts should take of the rest except for a couple of prompts for
optional setup.

** Configuration

- [[https://git-scm.com][Git]]
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash][Bash]] as the default shell
- [[https://fishshell.com][Fish]] as an alternate shell
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]] (now moved to a separate 
  repository [[https://github.com/myTerminal/.emacs.d][.emacs.d]] which 
  supports using more compatible configs like 
  [[https://github.com/myTerminal/super-emacs][super-emacs]] and 
  [[https://github.com/myTerminal/ample-emacs][ample-emacs]])
  - [[https://www.mew.org][mew]] as the email client
- [[https://i3wm.org][i3wm]] as a window manager on Linux
- [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][Rofi]] as a window switcher and
  application launcher on Linux
- [[https://hyper.is][Hyper]] as a terminal on macOS
- [[https://github.com/myTerminal/myterminal][myterminal]] as a command-line 
  companion
- [[https://github.com/sddm/sddm][SDDM]] (currently only the user avatar)

** Utility scripts

There's a growing collection of utility scripts included to help me with
my daily computing tasks.
